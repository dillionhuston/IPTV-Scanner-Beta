# IPTV Scanner

IPTV Scanner is a tool designed to scan, sort, and filter live channels from [iptv-org](https://github.com/iptv-org/iptv). It checks channel availability every three hours, listing active channels in `iptv_streams.json` and inactive or invalid streams (e.g., 404, 401 errors) in `dead_streams.json`. The included web GUI lets you view active channels and access them with a single click. Copy links to your preferred media player or run the service via supported external applications.

## Branches
